## 0.2.0 (2024.03.08)

### :rotating_light: Breaking Changes

- **editEntity** Remake it. See its new document.

### :rocket: Feature

- **loadGeojson** A new function to load geojson.
- **flyToArea** A new function that moves the camera to a position where all points are just visible.
- **moveByKeyboard** New api to customize keybinding.

### :lady_beetle: Bug

- **useViewerConfig** It can work good now. In the future, I hope it can replace setViewer. However, for the time being, setViewer will remain primary.

## 0.1.1 (2024.02.27)

### Feature

- **usePoints**: Now `onEach` has the second param which is the index of the loop.
